 *
 * - Don't solve problems that don't need to be solved.
 * - Don't worry about the future until you're sure you can survive the present.
 * - Build things for the fun of it.
 * - Don't add risk without a compelling and measurable benefit to the project.
 * - Don't invest in the future if your current project is in trouble.

 * Sprite class defines an object that:
 *  - is shown on the screen
 *  - can move
